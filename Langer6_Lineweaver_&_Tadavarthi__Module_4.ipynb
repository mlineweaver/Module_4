    "## Disease Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your assigned disease, fill in the following bullet points. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Prevalence & incidence: There has been an outbreak of monkeypox in the DR Congo with incidence in 2023 being 15,000 cases and increasing to 54,000 cases in 2024. There are currently over 46,000 cases in central and east Africa. Since the beginning of the year, in the DRC, there have been 20,000 reported cases of mpox and over 630 deaths. However, there is not a great system for reporting cases so these numbers are estimations. This outbreak has been deemed a public health emergency by the World Health Organization. \n",
    "* Economic burden: These outbreaks place a significant strain on healthcare financing in Africa. This leads to inadequate allocation of resources in an already overburdened healthcare system. This also raises the costs of out-of-pocket health expenses. The average allocation of government budgets to healthcare across Africa is 7.2%. An estimated $245 million is needed to combat the grwoing mpox outbreak in Africa and only 10% of that number has been secured. This means most of the financial burden is on patients. The average price for the mpox vaccine in Africa is between $100 and $140 per dose. \n",
    "* Risk factors (genetic, lifestyle) & Societal determinants: The biggest risk factor is coming into contact with someone that has the disease. However certain factors can cause more severe illness such as having a weakened immune system, a young age, and pregnancy. Specifically in the DR Congo risks include malnutrition, poor sanitation, population displacement, and ongoing conflict that weakens health systems and increase transmission. Sexual contact including having multiple sexual partners and unprotected anal sex. \n",
    "* Symptoms: Rash, fever, exhaustation, swollen lympth nodes, muscle aches, sore throat, blisters that crust over. \n",
    "* Diagnosis: Diagnosed by a healthcare provider that swabs the rash and the sample is tested in a lab (such as PCR test). \n",
    "* Biological mechanisms (anatomy, organ physiology, cell & molecular physiology): Folowing exposure to the respiratory secretions or bodily fluids of Mpox patients, the virus enters nearby tissues through mucous membrances or broken skin. The disease starts by entering a host cell, which is typically the skin. The virus replicates its DNA in the cytoplasm and assembles new virus particles. It then releases them to infect other cells. It first spreads to nearby lymph nodes and then into the bloodstream and other organs for a systemic infection. The virus also needs to evade the immune system so it will secrete proteins that interfere with immune signals and immune cell function. \n",
